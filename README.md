# vue-fhir-demo
This is a simple demo for using the [jsOnFhir](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@i4mi/js-on-fhir) wrapper in a Vue.js app.

It demonstrates how a connection to a FHIR server with OAuth2 (in this case [test.midata.coop](https://test.midata.coop)) can be made, and some basic actions on resources can be done. For testing, you need a user account on the test instance of midata.coop.
